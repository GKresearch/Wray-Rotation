These were test scripts tested out over the rotation, they are missing appropriate notation within. 
Should you have any questions regarding these scripts, there is a good chance that the final script used, held within Wray-Rotation/Scripts/ML_Harness_Updates, will include the correct notes.
Alternatively, you could contact me for any specifics.
