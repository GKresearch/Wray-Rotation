This directory includes the scripts completed during the ML harness portion of the rotation. 
The original plan was to update Jameson's ML Harness with additional models and data, but no additional data was ever recieved so much of the work of this part of the project was never truly completed.
The scripts included in this directory and subdirectory include the primary script in this directory, the Artificial Neural Network script in "ANNs", and obsolete test scripts in "Obsolete_ML_Scripts".

As mentioned, the additional data never materialized, so all work was done with just updating and adding additional models, then rerunning some of the tests on the created data from the TAD analysis, see more scripts and info from then in: "Wray-Rotation/Scripts/Proximity_Assingment_Testing_Pipeline".
