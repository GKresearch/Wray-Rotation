These were scripts that were made primarily by Jameson and Carl. I simply reran them as tests and took some of that information to place into the presentation and the other scripts. Feel free to look at these if you'd like, but there is a lot more info for these on: https://github.com/jb621-star/Wray-Rotation/tree/main/scripts

Feel free to contact me if there are issues, but as mentioned these aren't really my scripts.
